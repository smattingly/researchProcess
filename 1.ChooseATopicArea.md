# Choose a topic area	

Choose some broad area of knowledge that is relevant to your studies, and interesting to you. Assume that your audience is a group of skeptical alumni of this course who earned A grades.

For each of the items below, an example response from *The Craft of Research* is given. Replace the examples with your own responses.

## State a broad topic as a phrase of 4 or 5 words. 
```
the history of commercial aviation
```

## Narrow that broad topic by adding words that express actions or relationships. 
```
the contribution of the military in developing the DC-3 in the early years of commercial aviation
```

## Turn this expanded phrase into a full sentence that describes your research topic.  

If you can, try to interest your audience with a **claim**-- a sentence that asserts something that might or might not be true. If you are not ready to make a claim, that can come later.
```
In the early years of commercial aviation, the military contributed to the way the DC-3 developed.
```
